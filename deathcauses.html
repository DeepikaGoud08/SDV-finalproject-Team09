    <h2> Deaths due to nitrition disorder in 2019</h2>
    <h3> The below idioms shows the worldwide deaths due to nutritional disorders in the year 2019. The heatmap is used to represent the effect of the nutritional disorder for each country. The color ranges from cream color to maroon color. The darker tone represents the country with higher deaths and the lighter represents the one with least deaths. India has highest deaths of 26868.New Zealand has least deaths of 15 across the globe for nutritional disorder. United States and Mexico has deaths around 7000 to 8000 which is in the middle range of the color. When we hover on the country we get the death count which can be seen on New Zealand.</h3>
  <br>
  <h3>This is a scatter plot version of the same dataset which tells us the distribution of the countries with the death count and the color represents the intensity of deaths. As we can see most of the countries fall in between 0 to 2000 deaths only. That means most of the countries have deaths due to malnutrition in the range of 0 to 2000 which is a good sign. This can also implies that the countries have lower population. The one which is to the far right with dark color circle is India which has the highest number of deaths due to malnutrition in 2019.</h3>
